                You're probably wondering where you or your business may benefit from having a website or application. Contrary to popular belief, it's not actually impossible to succeed without a
                website or application in this day and age. That being said, it's increasingly more and more difficult as the years progress. The internet and technology has allowed us to reach wider
                audiences and demographics than ever before. Having a website, a one-stop-shop, for prospective clients and cusomters to see what you offer and how you go about business is paramount
                for the success of a small business. Time is the most valuable commodity in the world and people don't like to waste it. That's why it's important to have everything available in one
                central location. After all, modern problems require modern solutions.

                                Your website will rapidly increase the speed at which customers have access to your products or services. Without needing to call you, email you or stop by they have
                                all the information they need. Did you know that of the small businesses that have websites, 69% of them are having annual sales of $1,000,000 – $2,490,000

                                operation is too small to warrant a website - which is not reality. Having a website for your business, big or small, will directly improve how your customers perceive

                    I'd imagine you may be wondering: who is this guy and why would I trust him with my website? Allow me to introduce myself! My name is Tristan and I'm a lifelong computer and
                    technology enthusiast. From a very early age I knew - and my parents knew - that computers and engineering would be my calling. I was always fascinated with technology, what it
                    provided us as a society and its how it was harnessed to give us what we want and need. I also had an interest in learning how things worked. Computers and the internet are the
                    greatest inventions of all time. In today's day and age there is a computer everywhere you go. A computer controls almost everything you do and you control a computer to do almost
                    everything you want.
                </p>
                <p data-aos="zoom-in-right" class="flow-text">
                    Knowing how the world was evolving around technology I decided to learn how to properly harness it and become a computer programmer. I started by learning lower-level languages
                    like C++ and x86 Assembly. I was always interested in emulation and learning how video games were created to reverse engineer them into something I created on my own. Futher down
                    the road, I discovered web development (in its most basic forms) by learning HTML and CSS. These are two very important languages that create the bones of most web pages. HTML is
                    the structure and CSS is the style. Many people don't realize that they may already know some of this. Remember MySpace?
                </p>

                <p data-aos="zoom-in-right" class="flow-text">
                    Fast forward to recent years and I have learned many of the most advance topics in web developement and cyber security. I have developed applications and websites for numerous
                    different cases and I have applied my knowledge of these frameworks and design principles to aid me in doing so. With these technologies I am able to create, maintain and deploy
                    any sort of web application or website for any reason to any platform at any time. This webpage itself is a prime example of how you use and incorporate several frameworks,
                    technologies and design philosophies to create visually appealing and functional websites. If these things sound interesting or useful to you or your business you've come to the
                    right place.

                    of web development. Various cases apply, but for the most part a developer who posesses these skills are considered top of the line.

                    <p class="flow-text section">
                        Charts are a very important way to visualize and present datasets like sales, projections, productivity etc. There are hundreds of different ways to customize the charts to
                        visually strike your user(s) and present your data in a meaningful, professional and visually appealing way. I specialize, through my line of work, in presenting data and
                        analytics with the Charts.js library.

                        Animations are a very cool and interesting way to display sections on your website. There are various different ways you could do this, but in todays modern web design,
                        animations on scroll are probably some of the coolest and most sought after. These are some examples of what I can provide with content animation. The rest of this page will
                        also support animations as an example.
